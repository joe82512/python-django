            I am the bone of my sword
            Steel is my body and fire is my blood
            I have created over a thousand blades
            Unknown to Death
            Nor known to Life
            Have withstood pain to create many weapons
            Yet, those hands will never hold anything
            So as I pray       
            unlimited blade works
